                    One thing that's done every year is the Ponemon Institute Cost of Data Breach Study.
                    <img src="~/RootCauses.PNG" style=" width:400px; float:right" class="img-responsive" />
                    It's a very interesting study because they found that only 47% of data breaches were malicious.
                    53%, or the majority, was not malicious in any way. So, 28% of them are human error, which we'll
                    get to in a bit, and 25% are process failure. Process failure basically means you bought a
                    product and you never got it deployed, or you bought something and you never put it in place. So
                    something like if you purchase a security system but you never armed that security system.

                <p>
                    Human error, on the other hand, can be lost or stolen devices, most commonly. Most people think
                    when it comes to losing or having a device stolen, it's going to be lost or stolen from a coffee
                    or the airport, or somewhere where the user doesn't necessarily feel as safe. In fact, the majority
                    of devices are lost and stolen from work areas or vehicles. So, places where people wouldn't expect their
                    devices to be lost or stolen from. Especially the work area is very surprising to most people.
