                    There are many types of infections, including computer viruses, worms, Trojans, rootkits, ransomware, and spyware.
                    Often, several of these combined into one attack. The one most talked about this year is ransomware and this one that encrypts all your files so that you lose access to them.
                    Then asks you to pay a ransom in order to regain access. Careful though, usually despite paying you never regain access to your files.

                    What is important to know about malware is that malware continues to grow.
                    This is a graph that comes from AV tests, that shows the growth of malware over the years.
                    On the left-hand side is the total number of malware, and this is grouped by the year.
                    As you can see, it continues to grow year after year.

            <h2>More About Malware</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Now, the industry is at a point where, on average, we see about 390,000 unique threats per day. It is important to know that unique threats do not mean the same thing as they're extremely dissimilar.
                    What is meant by that is lots of threats are changed in the smallest amount possible to evade detection.
                    So, that could be one little part of the code, it could be one byte of the application.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Malicious threats are targeted to have a higher penetration rate or success rate. So, what that means is that people will go and find out who they're trying to attack.
                    Are they trying to attack Windows operating systems? What antivirus are they using, if any?
                    Then, once they have that information, they can build their malware in order to penetrate into those exact environments.
                </li><br />
                <li>
                    Once they're ready and their malware is successful, then they can deploy it to the target directly.
                    So, there definitely are people out there that are specifically targeting business and industries.
                    They're making sure that their malware will succeed in those places.
                </li>
            </ul><br />

            <h2>Is Malware Windows Only?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Is malware Windows only? This is the most common question that is asked. Malware definitely exists on other operating systems outside of Windows.
                    However, Windows is typically the major target, due to having the highest market share.
                </li><br />
                <li>
                    Malware authors, they want to have a large penetration rate. They want to get as many people infected as possible.
                    So, that means deploying malware designed for Windows, because it has the largest market.
                    And that's why they don't have to do as much work to get it, to take over as many computers as they might want.
                </li><br />
                <li>
                    However, when new malware is released on other operating systems, it typically has a pretty high penetration rate as well because people
                    believe that their Android, their Mac, and their Linux devices are safe without having any endpoint security at all.
                </li><br />
                <li>
                    So, when a piece of malware gets deployed to those OS', they don't have any protection to prevent it from getting on their system
                    and they have nothing in place to detect if their system is infected at all. So, that malware will sit on there for a very long time,
                    until something starts running funny, or they start wondering what's going wrong, then they put something on there to see what might be happening.
                    Then, they realize, "Oh, I've been having malware for several months."
                </li><br />

            <h2>Can Mobile Phones Be Affected By Malware?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Mobile phone malware is a growing threat due to users doing the majority of their internet browsing on a cell phone.
                    Ransomware, or screen locking malware, is a popular threat on mobile devices.
                </li><br />

                <li>
                    In 2016, malware targeting Apple iOS (iPhones, iPads) increased. Apple doesn’t allow vendors to create antivirus for these products,
                    so users must depend on the company to fix any vulnerabilities.
                </li><br />

                <li>
                    Mobile devices get infected very much in the same way as a computer; clicking malicious links in email,
                    downloading other apps that masquerade as correct apps, good apps, or apps that people actually want.
                    One of the most common ways for mobile devices to get infected is downloading apps directly from the internet,
                    rather than via the official stores, such as Google Play and Apple's App Store.
                </li><br />

                <li>
                    Doing that is a very easy way to get Malware because now you don't have Google and Apple verifying that these apps are legitimate.
                    You just start downloading an app from some other website that's not doing those verification checks for you.
                </li>
            </ul><br />
